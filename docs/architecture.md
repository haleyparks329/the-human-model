# Architecture

The Human Model is organized as a layered system.

## Repository Roles

### `human-model`

The foundation repo defines the source-of-truth project structure.

It is responsible for:

- Tracking schemas
- Data contracts
- Weekly review workflows
- Experiment design
- Research notes
- Future notebooks, dashboards, and hardware notes

The repo now also contains the first local Coach Dashboard V1 app. For this dashboard, SQLite is the canonical local store and Notion is treated as a mirror, review, and selected manual-input layer.

### `human-model-chatbot`

The chatbot repo is the capture and automation layer.

It is responsible for:

- Accepting natural-language Telegram inputs
- Calling a local LLM through Ollama
- Parsing structured recovery and workout logs
- Writing recovery entries to Notion
- Importing Apple Health exports into daily recovery rows
- OCR/importing Zenfit screenshots into structured Notion databases
- Running local scheduled jobs through macOS `launchd`
- Supporting Telegram workout logging, copy-forward templates, flexible load parsing, and workout notes
- Locally integrating Coach Dashboard V1 readiness computation in the working tree

### `the-human-model-overview`

This repo is the public narrative layer. It explains the system, implementation progress, roadmap, and product/research reasoning without exposing private health data or Notion database contents.

## Current Technical Stack

- Python
- Telegram bot API
- Ollama running a local model
- Notion as the early database and review layer
- SQLite as the local canonical store for Coach Dashboard V1
- FastAPI backend for the local dashboard
- Next.js frontend for the local dashboard UI
- Health Auto Export for Apple Health JSON exports
- Apple Vision/OCR flow through the Zenfit importer
- macOS `launchd` for local scheduled automation
- GitHub issues and repos for implementation planning
- Future analytics stack: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, Plotly, scikit-learn, Jupyter, Streamlit
- Future sensing stack: Arduino, IMU sensors, force sensors, possible EMG experiments

## First Working Loops

### Recovery Loop

```text
Apple Watch metrics + Telegram check-in
-> daily Recovery Tracking V1 row
-> weekly review
-> next training / recovery adjustment
```

### Training Context Loop

```text
Zenfit screenshots or Telegram workout log
-> OCR / parser / structured workout fields
-> Notion training log
-> future comparison against recovery and performance trends
```

### Local Dashboard Loop

```text
Notion / Telegram / Health exports / app entry
-> SQLite dashboard store
-> readiness result and data-health context
-> coach-style daily review
-> future weekly analysis
```

These loops give the project a working data spine before advanced modeling or hardware.
